# timeZone-in-cpp
This is my take on what I originally planned to create in Java, but in C++. Perhaps one day I will convert this to Java and figure out how to incorporate a GUI to accomplish various features of the function, rather than relying on user input in the command prompt window.

This is supposed to be a simple program with the main goal of allowing the user to input a time in one time zone and convert the time into another time zone.

Once the converting process is correct and complete, other features can be added such as reading in a text file containing many lines of time and mass converting them into a different time zone(s).
Another possible feature is the ability to save a "profile" that can be loaded up and would automatically convert the times in the profile to the saved time zones within the profile. This "profile" idea comes from watching streamers on Twitch who upload their streaming schedules and typically mass convert their local time zone into the various major time zones in the world.
